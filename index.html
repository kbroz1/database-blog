            <h4>Securing Your Devices</h4>
            <img src="https://today.duke.edu/sites/default/files/styles/story_hero/public/Security%20HERO_0.jpg?itok=1uDG8Efk"alt="secured device" width="350px" height="250px">
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Wondering how to keep your devices secure? </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Follow these easy steps!</h5>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>USE STRONG PASSWORDS/BIOMETRICS</li>
                <p>Strong passwords coupled with biometric features, such as fingerprint authenticators, make
                    unauthorized access nearly impossible. Your passwords should be eight or more characters long and -->
                    <!-- contain alphanumeric characters. If your mobile device allows two-factor authentication, don’t
                    hesitate to use it. You don’t want to be subject to unforeseen attacks.</p>
                <li>ENSURE PUBLIC OR FREE WI-FI IS PROTECTED</li>
                <p>To protect against Wi-Fi hacking, use applications that secure your connection or at least tell you
                    the status of the Wi-Fi to which you are connected. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is more secure
                    compared to WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy).</p>
                <li>UTILIZE VPN</li>
                <p>If you’re not sure about the security status of the network to which you’re connected, using VPN
                    (Virtual Private Network) client is mandatory. A VPN will enable you to connect to a network
                    securely. At the same time, any browsing activity you do on the public Wi-Fi will be shielded from
                    prying eyes.

                </p>
                <li>ENCRYPT YOUR DEVICE</li>
                <p>Most mobile devices are bundled with a built-in encryption feature. Encryption is the process of
                    making data unreadable. Decryption is converting the unreadable data into normal data. This is
                    important in case of theft, and it prevents unauthorized access. You simply need to locate this
                    feature on your mobile device and enter a password to encrypt your device.</p>
                <li>INSTALL AN ANTIVIRUS APPLICATION</li>
                <p>The files you download and the apps you install on your mobile device might be packed with malicious
                    code. Once launched, this code could send your data to hackers, thereby making you unsecured and
                    robbing you of your privacy. To avoid that, installing a reputable antivirus application will
                    guarantee your security.</p>
                <li>UPDATE TO THE LATEST SOFTWARE</li>
                <p>Your mobile device firmware might also be vulnerable to security threats. New loopholes might be
                    exploited leaving your device open to threats, to avoid that, always update your firmware/device.
                    Major mobile device firmware companies, such as Google Android and Apples iOS, roll out new updates
                    from time to time. Most of those updates act as a security patch to known vulnerabilities on your
                    device. You might set up updates to be manual or automatic.</p>

                        wheels. Bluetooth speakers have become the new standard for individual stereo use. It also makes
                        daily tech tasks like printing easier.

                        signals to allow us to precisely navigate the world</td>
                    <td>GPS has surely made the most impact in my life, and possible society at large. I use Google Maps
                        almost every day to navigate through space - even when I am using the same route I always use!
                        It has created a dependence on machines. Most people depend on their GPS app to get them to
                        wherever they need to go. It is also used widely for safety and crime reduction. We can track
                        where people are by using GPS. It has also created a demand for an entire economic market based
                        on selling people's locations. Businesses can track where you are and push specific ads to you
                        to get you to buy a product. There are benefits and disadvantages to GPS, but overall, it is a
                        necessary tool.</td>

                        devices so that all of our devices contain the same data.</td>
                    <td>Syncing has made a huge impact on our society. Nowadays, many devices automatically sync to a
                        cloud-based system. This allows us to have an unlimited amount of storage for photos, messages,
                        gaming data, etc. It is a huge benefit to have this feature, but I also think it poses a great
                        security risk. It provides an opportuniy for cyber hackers to steal information from cloud-based
                        systems that hold sensitive infomration and use it to exploit or hurt people.</td>

            <p>Overall, the MacBook has a far larger capacity and storage system than the Chromebook. It will be a
                better option for people who have many files and data such as photographers, gamers, data storers. The
                biggest disadvantage of the MacBook is the price. It is substantially more expensive than the
                Chromebook. The Chromebook has plenty of storage and features that would be great for a college student
                or for a work computer. </p>

            <h4>How the Internet Works</h4>
            <h5><strong>What is the internet?</strong></h5>
            <p>
                <br>
                The Internet is a huge collection of wide area networks and computers that are connected to each other.
                These networks allow data to be transferred and shared between the computers and devices connected to
                them.
                <br>
                The devices that we use to connect to the internet (our phones, laptops) connect to websites that are
                run
                through servers. For example, Google has its own computer and servers that house all of the information
                that
                we access when we google something.
                <br>
                Whenever we search for something on the internet, the information is requested as a "packet" and it
                travels
                through the Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast) to a server (like Google) through routers which
                tell
                the packet where to go. Then the packet travels back to your device with the information you requested.
